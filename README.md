## ✨ Features

### 📅 Weekly Plans (v2.0+)
The core concept: **A "plan" is a full week** — not a single workout.

- **Weekly Plan Architecture** — Create plans like "4FB+1Arms" or "PPL" with multiple days
- **Per-Day Exercise Assignment** — Each day has its own exercises with default sets/reps
- **Rest Day Support** — Mark any day as a rest day with one tap
- **Active Plan Tracking** — Set any plan as active, app remembers where you left off
- **Day Selector** — Pick which day of your weekly plan you're doing today

### 🏋️ Core Tracking
- **Exercise Library** — Centralized list of all exercises (Settings → Exercise Library)
- **Custom Exercises** — Create your own with name and muscle group
- **Active Workout Mode** — Log weight, reps, mark sets complete in real-time
- **Auto-fill Weights** — Pre-fills exact weight pattern from last session (e.g., 48kg, 52kg, 48kg)
- **Rest Timer** — Preset buttons (1:00, 1:30, 2:00, 3:00) with vibration alerts
- **Auto Rest Day Detection** — Prompts to log missed days as rest days

### 📊 Progress & Stats
